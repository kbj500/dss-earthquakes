# LANL Earthquake Prediction

*Author:* Anders Poirel

This the Data Science Slugs team's repository for the [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction) competition on Kaggle.

## Getting Started

### Software Prerequisites

#### Github

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a user account.
Message Ryan Darling or Anders Poirel on Slack so that you can be added as a collaborator on the project on GitHub. This is will be necessary for pushing your contributions to our repo.

#### Git
Get the official installer [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Be sure to select Git Bash at installation if you are on Windows. 
You can also use a GUI for Git but knowing command line will make things much easier for everyone down the line. If you do not know any git, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a great resource to get you started. 

#### Visual Studio Code
You can use any editor you like, but to participate in live code collaboration you *will* need VS Code.
Get the official installer [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Launch VS Code and in **Extensions** (*Ctrl+Shift+X*) search 'VS Live Share' and install. I also highly recommend installing the 'Python' package from Microsoft and  the 'Rainbow CSV' package, for improved Python and CSV support.
To enable the 'code' bash command, open Command Palette and type 'shell command' then select 'Install code command PATH'. 

At each meeting, links to join a live code collaboration will be sent out through Slack.

#### Anaconda

*Note: this is only necessary if you intend to run the code on your local machine. You can get started without it. Also, a lot of the above software can be installed through Anaconda if you prefer.*

Download the official installer [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Be sure to select the **Python 3.7 version**. 
I will list here as needed the Python libraries you will need to install through Anaconda.

### Setting up your environment

#### First time setup

*Note: I highly recommend reading the first 2 chapter of the book ProGit, freely available online, to get a working knowledge of git*

Create a folder to store our work on the project.

```bash
$ mkdir DataScienceSlugs
$ cd DataScienceSlugs
```

Copy the repository to your local machine, adding it as a remote - Use the name and email you used on GitHub.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Jonh Doe"
$ git config --global user.email  jonhdoe@example.com
$ git clone https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes
```

#### Accessing the project

Navigate to the folder containing the project and then
run

```bash
$ git checkout testing
$ git pull origin testing
$ code [file you want to work on]
```

Which will open the file in VSCode

**All** work should be done on the testing branch, or even better, branches created specifically for the issue you want to work on.
